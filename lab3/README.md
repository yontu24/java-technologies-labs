Create a Web application using JavaServer Faces technology, dedicated to Sports Tournament Scheduling
"The problem is to schedule a tournament of n teams over nâˆ’1 weeks, with each week divided into n/2 periods, and each period divided into two slots.
The first team in each slot plays at home, whilst the second plays the first team away.
A tournament must satisfy the following three constraints: every team plays once a week; every team plays at most twice in the same period over the tournament; every team plays every other team."
Each team has the following properties: name, founding date, city.

The main specifications of the application are:
