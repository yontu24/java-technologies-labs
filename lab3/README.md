Create a Web application using JavaServer Faces technology, dedicated to Sports Tournament Scheduling
"The problem is to schedule a tournament of n teams over n−1 weeks, with each week divided into n/2 periods, and each period divided into two slots.
The first team in each slot plays at home, whilst the second plays the first team away.
A tournament must satisfy the following three constraints: every team plays once a week; every team plays at most twice in the same period over the tournament; every team plays every other team."
Each team has the following properties: name, founding date, city.

The main specifications of the application are:
# Compulsory
Create the following:

* A relational database in order to store and retrieve data. (PostgreSQL is recommended).
* You should have at least the tables: teams and cities.
* A JSF project using Maven
* A web page for viewing the teams in the database.

# Homework
* Create the support for managing the teams, using a datatable.
* Define a page for creating a new team or editing an existing one, using a modal dialog. Use appropriate components for specifying the date and the city.
