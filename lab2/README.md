# Compulsory
Create a Web application (starting from the previous lab) containing the following components:
* input.jsp: a page containing a form for introducing some letters and a size.
* result.jsp a page describing the response that will be delivered to the client, for example an HTML table containing the words of the given size.

# Homework
Organize the application so it contains:
* an object-oriented domain model;
* a server-side component responsible with the business-logic of the application: writing the words to a file, reading data from a file, etc.
* a server-side component responsible with controlling the web-flow.
* A web filter that will log all requests received by input.jsp.
* A web filter that will decorate the response by adding a specific prelude (at the beginning) and a specific coda (at the end) to the generated HTML page.
